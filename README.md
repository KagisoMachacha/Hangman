# Hangman
Decide to create a hangman game in java for my journey in learning the language. Might decide to add an interface to it

### IntelliJ
To open it in `IntelliJ` IDE:
1. _File_ -> _New_ -> _Project from Existing Sources..._
1. Select the directory where this code has been checked out to by the LMS
1. Choose _External Model_ as *Maven*

## Build, Test & Run
You may use IntelliJ to run your code and tests, but alternatively you can use the Maven build tool:
* First ensure you are in the root directory of the project
* To compile your code, run: `mvn compile`
* To run the tests: `mvn test`
* To run your application: `mvn compile exec:java`
